These are part of the OpenMD software which is an open-source molecular dynamics engine with built-in analysis codes. The OpenMD github is located at https://github.com/OpenMD and more information on OpenMD can be found at https://openmd.org/

omdcombined.py: This code allows for the merging of multiple solvent, solute, and ligand files for molecular dynamics simulations. This improved upon the original code which wouldn't allow for smooth merging of solutes with both rigid and non-rigid solute/ligand components.

hbondz: This code allows for binning of hydrogen bonds as a function of z in planar geometries.

hbondzvol: This code allows for binning of hydrogen bond density per unit volume in planar geometries.

hbondr: This code allows for binning of hydrogen bonds as a function of r in spherical geometries.

hbondrvol: This code allows for binning of hydrogen bonds per unit volume in spherical geometries.
